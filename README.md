# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Naive-Bayes-Classification
In this project, I have trained a Naive Bayes classifier to predict sentiment from thousands of Twitter tweets. This project could be practically used by any organization with social media presence to automatically predict customer's sentiment (i.e.: whether their customers are happy or not). The process could be done automatically without having humans manually review thousands of tweets and customer reviews.
